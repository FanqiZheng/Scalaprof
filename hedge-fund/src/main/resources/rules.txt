# Rules.txt

# This file defines the rules that are used in the Hedge Fund application.
# There are currently two required rules: put and call.
# Each candidate option must satisfy the RHS of the appropriate rule.
# Note that the variables on the RHS must be defined as a term in the appropriate model,
#   for example GoogleOptionModel.
# And, furthermore, the term definition must correspond to a property in the
#   candidateWithProperties defined in OptionAnalyzer#applyRules

# See RuleParser for the details of the rules DSL
