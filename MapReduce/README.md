# MapReduce

#Introduction
This project offers a general method of implementing Map/Reduce via Akka.
It is not intended as an open-source project.
Rather it is presented as an example of how to use Akka as part of the class I'm teaching
entitled Big Data Systems Engineering using Scala.

#Components
##MapReduce
This is the main class that is referenced directly by applications.
- X: the input type                  
- K: the key type                
- V: the value type (and the result type)

##Examples/CountWords
This is an example application of MapReduce.
